Homework HW4
=============

In this homework, you are expected to run Python or Java programs on FutureSystems or on your local machine. A few examples for beginners will help you to understand how to write and run Java or Python programs on your environment.

First Program
--------------
This code explains how to display a simple string on your screen. You can download or write your own code using your editor.

Java
^^^^^
:download: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cglmoocs/JavaFiles/master/FirstProgram.java`

.. code-block:: java

  /**
  * Sample Program to print out a message
  * 
  * Compile : javac FirstProgram.java
  * 	Run    : java FirstProgram
  */
  public class FirstProgram {	
  	public static void main(String[] args){
		  System.out.println("My first program on Big Data Applications and Analytics!");
	  }
  }

This example prints out the message on your screen by ``println`` method in the ``System`` class.
In Java Programming, you need to complie your code to execute.

Compiling and Execution
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

::
  
  javac FirstProgram.java
   
Now, you will have FirstProgram.class file on your system. Java Compiler (javac) creates Java bytecode with a ``.class`` extension. We will execute the class file with ``java`` command.

::

  java FirstProgram
  My first program on Big Data Applications and Analytics!


Python
^^^^^^^
Let's write a same program in Python.
