Cloud Computing on FutureSystems
================================

FutureSystems offers IaaS Cloud platforms (e.g. OpenStack Havana, Icehouse or Juno) to support Big Data applications on the cloud.
Interactive shell, Cloudmesh, provides a powerful interface to manage, create or delete virtual machines on FutureSystems.

This repository contains tutorials, manuals and other materials to help students, scientists or employees who want to use FutureSystems.
The main contents are:

 * virtual cluster
 * hadoop cluster
 * mongodb cluster

To build one of these clusters on FutureSystems, Cloudmesh uses OpenStack Heat and Chef recipes.
Examples and excercises on this documentation help you create and use vitual machines on FutureSystems including establishing these clusters.
