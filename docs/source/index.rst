Cloud Computing on FutureSystems
================================

FutureSystems offers IaaS Cloud platforms (e.g. OpenStack Havana, Icehouse or
Juno) to support Big Data applications on the cloud. Virtual clusters are
available on FutureSystems for distributed and parallel computing applications.

This documentation contains tutorials, manuals and other materials to help
students, scientists or employees who want to use cluster computing
environments on FutureSystems.  The main contents are:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   virtual_cluster
   hadoop_cluster
   mongodb_cluster

To build one of these clusters on FutureSystems, Cloudmesh uses OpenStack Heat
and Chef recipes. Interactive shell, Cloudmesh, provides a powerful interface
to manage, create or delete virtual machines on FutureSystems.

Examples and exercises on this documentation help you create and use virtual
machines on FutureSystems including establishing these clusters.
